Patched:
- the unicode symbol \xd7 was replaced with a banal 'x'. I don't know how to
  handle it properly on the graphics scene on one hand. On the other hand it's
  not really a big deal.
- arrow size is set to 0.0. It allows receiving the full path for a connection
  and later add the arrow on the graphics scene.
- changed the way how a function name is formed to make it consistent with a
  table representation and the standard pstats output
- adding the function id as a suffix to the label. This label will be stripped
  at the time of preparing a graph scheme and used to find the corresponding
  file name/line/type of module.
