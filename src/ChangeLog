* Sometimes pylint reports absolute paths so it is respected now.
* When completion is called and a temporary rope project is created,
  exclude all the subdirectories where there are no __init__.py[3] files.
  This mitigate a setup with a network home dir ( or network file location)
  in a directory where there are lots of subdirectories
* Add a shortcut in the 'Open file' dialog to the directory where the
  current tab file (if so) is.
* Add file to the recent files list at the time of closing a tab as well
  (not only at the time of opening). Otherwise a file is not there when it
  was loaded from a command line and then its tab is closed.
* Do not loose the current editor position when there was an incremental
  search on a tab and then another tab is closed.
* Prevent loosing selection in case switching between history positions
  if nothing has been changed in the required buffer.
* Have the find-in-files dialog interruptible at the stage of building
  the list of files to search in.

  Server. Issue #334
* Early logging on Windows based X Server could lead to crashes so some
