The directory holds a set of .css files.
The .css files can be put in subdirectories
Each file holds a style sheet for a certain form.

The actual css must follow to what is supported by QT.
There are a few extensions though:
- // started lines are considered as remarks. The '//' symbol must be at
  the beginning of the line.
- INCLUDE <path to a file> is supported. INCLUDE must start at 0 position

The extensions are processed first and then an assembled text is passed to
the application.
