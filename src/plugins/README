Codimension plugins subsystem.

There are two places where codimension looks for plugins:
- system wide: <installation path>/codimension/plugins/
- user: ~/.codimension/plugins/

Codimension expects that each plugin occupies a designated directory and there
are at least 3 files in each directory:
- file.yapsy-plugin -> plugin description
- file.py -> plugin implementation
- __init__.py

There no limits neither on the number of plugins nor the number of filies in a
plugin directory.

Each plugin could be enabled or disabled. By default a plugin is enabled however
it could be disabled by the user or by codimension (if codimension detects poor
implementation or a conflict).

Each plugin must provide information at least about its name and its version
(goes to file.yapsy-plugin).
In case if the same name plugin is found both in the system wide location and in
the user directory the priority is given to the user plugin and the system one is
automatically disabled. If the same name plugins are located in the system wide
directory or in the user directory then the priority is given to the higher plugin
version and the lower plugin version is automatically disabled.

Each plugin must belong to a predefined plugin category. Depending on the category
codimension expects a certain communication protocol.

Implementation of a plugin basically includes inheriting from a plugin category
base class and implementing the required methods of the base class.
