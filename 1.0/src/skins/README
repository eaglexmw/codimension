Individual directories hold all the files required to set a codimension skin.

A skin is comprosed from:
- application style sheet (QT format + codimension extensions, see below)
- lexers styles
- general settings


QT css + codimension extensions:
--------------------------------
A directory may hold a set of .css files.
The .css files can be put in subdirectories

The actual css must follow to what is supported by QT.
There are a few extensions though:
- // started lines are considered as remarks. The '//' symbol must be at
  the beginning of the line.
- INCLUDE <path to a file> is supported. INCLUDE must start at 0 position

The extensions are processed first and then an assembled text is passed to
the application.
