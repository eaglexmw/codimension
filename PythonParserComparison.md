# Codimension Brief Python Parser #

## Overview ##

Codimension needs to collect information about the content of each python module. In some cases, e.g. for the file system browser, a brief information is enough. In other cases, e.g. for the graphics python control flow editor a detailed information is required.

The standard python module pyclbr does not suite well codimension needs in brief parsing so codimension introduces its own implementation of it. The standard modules looses in speed and in the granularity of the provided information.

The codimension brief python parser is implemented as an extension module written in C with a bit of the python glue code. The C code uses [ANTLR](http://www.antlr.org/) v3 tool to generate lexer and parser of the python code.


## Comparison ##

The table below shows the comparison between the standard `pyclbr` module and the codimensionâ€™s `cdmbriefparser` module.
